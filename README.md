# MTGCardLookup
## This is a simple Python script that allows the user to input via command line multiple Magic The Gathering Multiverse IDs, and exports it into a Markdown format for visual splendor.

# Installation
## I have uploaded a simple tutorial which can be found on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/xOAljqbMIWY)
For this to run properly, you will need to install the following:
> - Python 3 (this was run on 3.12.4 to be specific, and link is found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
> - MTGSDK (installs via Python3's pip function)

From here, you will run the following command(s) within a command prompt:
`pip install mtgsdk`
`python3 <filepath>` (EX: `python3 C:/Code/MTGdata.py`)

# Functions
Once the file is active and running, please simply input all IDs* into the terminal then press enter. Once all are added, type `export` to select a filepath.
(EX: `./myfile`, `C:/Code/myfile`)

*NOTE: Valid IDs MUST be accurate, otherwise this will not function

## The final result will appear something along the lines of this:

# Sliver Legion

**Color Identity**: B, G, R, U, W

**Rarity**: Mythic

**Printed Sets**: Future Sight, Judge Gift Cards 2019, Secret Lair Drop, Time Spiral Remastered
